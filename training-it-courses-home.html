<h3>Computer languages course</h3>

<ol>
	<li><a href="C">C</a></li>
	In beginning, One needs to focus on basics of programming. C is the programming language one should focus. If one needs to program in embedded-system, one must make oneself comfortable before going ahead
	with any language. In case you don't wish to get in embedded-system and don't have any semester obligation, you may start with Java or Python.
    <li><a href="C_Plus_12th">C++</a></li>
	C++ is the object-oriented programming. In current situation, in case you don't have any semester obligation, you may skip this language and may proceed ahead to Java or Python.
    <li><a href="java-core">Java</a></li>
	<p>	Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language and it is platform-independent, so can run on linux, window or mac. Java initial constructs are similar to C language and object-oriented feature are better than C++.  So if you are not coming from C and C++ background, and want to learn your first programming language, I will suggest choosing Java. Java has rich API and has wonderful community support. Java is very secure language. Java language is base course for Android App Development, J2EE Web application, Big Data Courses, Software Testing Automation Selenium etc.  In terms of Job opportunities, again Java outscores everyone.
	<BR> To learn Java, you may join Sisoft learning <a href="java-core">class room course</a> at Indirapuram or<a href="learner_course_view.php?id=19"> Self-paced online module</a> from anywhere. Our curriculum includes online study material, online query resolution, assignments, and assessments.
    </p>
    <li><a href="Python">Python</a></li>
	<p> Python is open source versatile high level language. Python has procedural language construct as well as object oriented language construct, so one hand this is similar to C and another hand this may be compared with Java. It is dynamic typed language and  interpreted language. This is easy to learn.
<br> The best part of python is its libraries. Depending on the type of work, one may select modules/libraries. Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. The libraries for web development are Django and  web2py. Libraries for Data Analytics are NumPy, SciPy, Panda and IPython etc. With the rise of big data, Python developers are in demand as data scientists, especially since Python can be easily integrated into web applications to carry out tasks that require machine learning.  In addition, PyGames is a neat game engine to build games with if you want to make simple games.
